# Quinterac Project

The product that is designed is an Queen's Old-Fashioned Interactive Banking System ("Quinterac"). Quinterac consists of two parts:

    - the Front end, a banking transaction acceptor for simple ATM-style banking transactions
    - the Back Office, an overnight batch processor to maintain and update a master accounts file.
